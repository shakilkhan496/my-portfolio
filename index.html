            <h3 class="header2">The true ENTREPRENEUR is a risk taker, not an excuse maker</h3>
            <p class="header2">If you don’t love what you do, don’t do it. I truly believe it’s as simple as that.

                As an entrepreneur, you’re going to have to put in long hours and make sacrifices for your business.

                When you’re passionate about what you do, putting in the long hours won’t feel like a sacrifice anymore.

                If you’re not passionate about what you do, you’re not going to have the motivation to keep going when
                you’re stressed and tired.

                Have you ever noticed those entrepreneurs who never seem to get tired? Those entrepreneurs who get that
                gleam in their eye when they talk about what they do? That’s passion.
